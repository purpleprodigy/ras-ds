<h3>Understanding my results</h3>
<p>At the bottom of each domain or area of recovery, there is a total score and there is a percentage score. There is also an overall score and an overall percentage. The “scores” are a total of all of the scores for that section. The "percentage" is the total score divided by the number of items and then converted to a percentage. We think the percentage scores are most useful because they allow you to compare how well you are doing in different domains. Because each domain has different numbers of statements, the total scores for the domains with more statements are likely to be bigger, so it makes it harder to compare. However, it is important to recognise that the percentage scores are not any indication of "passing" or "failing" in any domain. It just makes comparing the different domains easier. In recovery, there is no passing or failing, just progress.</p>
<p>Using the percentage scores allows you to see which domains or areas of recovery you are doing best in as well as those ones you might want to work on to improve. However, the area you want to focus on might not be the statement you marked lowest or the domain with the lowest percentage. It is probably going to be the thing or things that you feel are most important to you. What you wrote in the right-hand column might help you decide what matters most to you. We suggest having a conversation with someone else that you trust about what you scored and what you most want to work on now. Speaking aloud often helps clear our thoughts! The RAS-DS workbook on the website might help you think about how to get started on your chosen area. If you want to check out the information and exercises in the workbook, take a note of the domain / area of recovery you want to focus on and click on the "Go to the workbook" button above and explore the workbook for that domain / area.</p>
