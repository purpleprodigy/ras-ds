== Description ==

**Gravity PDF is the ultimate solution for generating digital PDF documents using Gravity Forms and WordPress.**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zKKrjmNjY

The plugin ships with four highly-customisable PDF templates perfectly suited for displaying your user’s data. Within seconds you can personalise the documents with your company logo, change the font, size, colour and the paper size. If the templates don't suit, [have one tailor made just for you](https://gravitypdf.com/integration-services/) or [roll your own](https://gravitypdf.com/documentation/v4/developer-start-customising/).

> Digital document management with WordPress just became a breeze!

= Feature =

* There’s no third-party APIs needed when generating your PDFs. That means no monthly fees or rate limits. You control the software and the documents it generates.
* We support all languages, including complex symbol-based languages like Chinese and Japanese, as well as Right to Left (RTL) written languages such as Arabic and Hebrew.
* Automatically email your PDF when a user completes a form. Have it emailed to people in your organisation, the user, or both. You can also conditionally generate and email the PDF.
* Using Gravity Forms’ developer-licensed payment add-ons – like PayPal, Authorize.net or Stripe – you can restrict access to the PDF until after a payment is captured.
* [Protecting your user’s sensitive information is the at the heart of Gravity PDF](https://gravitypdf.com/documentation/v4/user-pdf-security/). The plugin’s security settings give you granular control over who has access to the PDFs generated.
* Our [JavaScript-powered font manager](https://gravitypdf.com/documentation/v4/user-custom-fonts/) allows you to install and use your favourite fonts. Now you can keep in line with your corporate style guide, or create beautiful PDF typography.
* [The documentation](https://gravitypdf.com/documentation/v4/user-installation/) has everything from basic install instructions to advanced developer how-to guides. Our friendly team is also on hand to [provide FREE general support](https://gravitypdf.com/support/).
* PHP, HTML and CSS come easy? [You’ll find creating your own PDF templates a breeze](https://gravitypdf.com/documentation/v4/developer-start-customising/). If not, [we offer PDF design services](https://gravitypdf.com/integration-services/) tailored just for you. We can even auto-fill existing PDFs!

= Requirements =

Gravity PDF can be run on most shared web hosting without any issues. It requires **PHP 5.4+** (PHP 7.0+ recommended) and at least 64MB of WP Memory (128MB+ recommended). You'll also need to be running WordPress 4.2+ and have Gravity Forms 1.9+.

[Don't have Gravity Forms? Purchase a license](https://goo.gl/lsBOef) (any license type will do, although a Developer license will give you the best bang for the buck). If you aren't sure Gravity PDF will meet your needs (and haven't got a Gravity Forms license yet) you can [try out the software via our demo site](https://demo.gravitypdf.com).

= Documentation & Support =

[We have extensive documentation on using Gravity PDF](https://gravitypdf.com/documentation/v4/five-minute-install/), and our friendly support team provides [FREE basic support via our website](https://gravitypdf.com/support/#contact-support) (we also check the WordPress.org forums but submitting a ticket via GravityPDF.com will get a faster response).

= Custom PDF Integration =

We offer **comprehensive PDF integration services** and do all the PDF development and integration into Gravity Forms for you. You tell us what you want and our friendly and experienced developers will design, develop and install custom PDF templates tailor specifically for you. We can even auto-fill your existing PDF documents. [Find out more at GravityPDF.com](https://gravitypdf.com/integration-services/).
